# Week 03 

## Overview
This project consists of three main tasks:
1. **Exponential Weighted Covariance Matrix Calculation:** Implementing a routine to calculate the exponentially weighted covariance matrix using stock returns and performing PCA analysis to understand the impact of different \( \lambda \) values.
2. **Nearest Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) Matrix Calculation:** Implementing methods to compute the nearest PSD matrix using various approaches, including Cholesky decomposition and Highamâ€™s method, and comparing their performance.
3. **Multivariate Normal Simulation:** Simulating multivariate normal distributions using covariance matrices generated by different methods and comparing the accuracy and runtime of direct simulation versus PCA-based simulation.
